1. Make sure you setup the database (see `setup.sql`):

* SQL Server Express installed and accessible as `.\SQLEXPRESS`.
* Create a databases `shared` and
* add schemas: `error`,  `sender` and `receiver` (schemas are stored under *security* folder in SSMS database tree). See the file `setup.sql`
2. Start the Sender project (right-click on the project, select the `Debug > Start new instance` option). 
3. Start the Receiver project.
4. In the Sender's console you should see `Press <enter> to send a message` text when the app is ready. 
5. Hit <enter>.
6. On the Receiver console you should see that order was submitted.
7. On the Sender console you should see that the order was accepted.
8. Finally, after a couple of seconds, on the Receiver console you should see that the timeout message has been received.
9. Open SQL Server Management Studio and go to the receiver database. Verify that there is a row in saga state table (`receiver.OrderLifecycleSagaData`) and in the orders table (`receiver.Orders`)

## Code walk-through

This sample contains three projects: 

 * Messages - A class library containing the messages.
 * Sender - A console application responsible for sending the initial `OrderSubmitted` message and processing the follow-up `OrderAccepted` message.
 * Receiver - A console application responsible for processing the order message.

Sender and Receiver use different schemas within one database. This creates a nice separation on logical level (schemas can be secured independently) while retaining the benefits of having a single physical database. Each schema contains, apart from business data, queues for the NServiceBus endpoint and tables for NServiceBus persistence.

### Sender project
 
The Sender does not store any data. It mimics the front-end system where orders are submitted by the users and passed via the bus to the back-end. It is configured to use SQLServer transport with NHibernate persistence. The transport is configured to use a non-standard schema `sender` and to send messages addressed to `receiver` endpoint to a different schema.

<!-- import SenderConfiguration -->

The connection strings for both persistence and transport need to be exactly the same.

<!-- import SenderConnectionStrings -->

### Receiver project

The Receiver mimics a back-end system. It is also configured to use SQL Server transport with NHibernate persistence but instead of hard-coding the other endpoint's schema, it uses a convention based on the endpoint's queue name.

<!-- import ReceiverConfiguration -->

It is essential to tell NHibernate what schema should it use while accessing the database. The persistence tables have hard-coded names so if more than one endpoint uses the database, they *must* use different schemas.

<!-- import NHibernate -->

When the message arrives at the Receiver, a `TransactionScope` is created that encompasses
 * dequeuing the message
 * persisting business data using the shared session,
 * persisting saga data of `OrderLifecycleSaga` ,
 * sending the reply message and the timeout request.

<!-- import Reply -->

<!-- import Timeout -->

The shared session is managed by NServiceBus hence no need to explicitly begin a transaction or `Flush()` the session. 

<!-- import StoreUserData -->

The downside of this approach is, it makes it impossible to use NHibernate's second level cache feature since it requires usage of NHibernate's transactions and letting NHibernate manage its database connections, both of which are disabled when operating in shared connection mode.
